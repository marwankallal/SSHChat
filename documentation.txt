	In order to run on any Unix based system such as Linux or Mac, just open SSHCChatMac.command. This will open the terminal window and run the .jar file for you. If you are using windows or any other system, use the command line to navigate to the folder where SSHChat.jar is contained and execute "java -jar SSHChat.jar" (without quotes). Once you do this, you will be prompted to make a choice between making only a client (1), hosting a server (2), and running both simultaneously (3). When running a server on your computer, it will be run as localhost (127.0.0.1). When connecting to another server using option (1), you can use the servers internal IP address as the host if you are on the same local network. If the server is on a different network, you'll have to set up port forwarding on your router in order for it to accept outside connections.
	Option (3) will run a server on you localhost and then create a client that automatically connects to it. You may create multiple servers on one machine, but they must be on different ports. If you chose option (1) or (3), you will be able to chat with other people. You may type at any time, and press enter to send your message to all other users on the server. Users can be identified by their handle, which is automatically created for them. In order to send a private message visible to only one user, type "@<handle>::<message>" replacing <handle> and <message> with their handle and your message respectively, and as always, without quotes.

NOTE: DO NOT remove any of the files in the distribution folder, all are necessary for the smooth performance of the software.
